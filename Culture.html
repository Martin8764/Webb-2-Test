        <h1>Food</h1>
        <br>
        <p>A large part of Icelandic culture boils down to both food and doing outside activities. Their culture has been around for a long time and some things even date back to the age when Vikings still roamed the seas.

            A lot of the food they eat in Iceland consists of fresh and locally sourced lamb and fish. Lamb is farmed on the large fields and farms on the island and fish is fished on its great and beautiful shores.
            
            Another large part of the Icelandic cuisine is dairy products, mostly cheese and skyr. Skyr is the Icelandic equivalent of yogurt.

            <h1>Sports</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The outside activities that the people of Iceland partake in are not that different from  other parts of the world. Iceland has become quite modernised over the last few centuries with the children of the island playing football and basketball but some older activities still remain popular even with the younger generations.

                Icelandic horse riding and chess is popular on the island and can be dated back to the ancestral vikings of Iceland, chess was a game actually favored by the vikings that lived on Iceland and the game still remains relevant all these years later.

        <h1>Viking roots</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Iceland is a nordic country believed to be first inhabited by norse vikings in the ninth century. The island's connection to the vikings can still be seen in some of its traditions.
            
            The Icelandic people are proud of this heritage and do a great deal of things to preserve it. A great example of this is the modern Icelandic language which still closely resembles the old norse language that used to be spoken by its first inhabitants.
